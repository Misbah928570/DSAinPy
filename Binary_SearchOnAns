Binary search on answer works when:
  There exists a condition like:
      If mid works → anything larger also works
      OR
      If mid works → anything smaller also works

// LC875. Koko Eating Bananas
```
  class Solution:
    def minEatingSpeed(self, piles: List[int], h: int) -> int:
        left = 1
        right = max(piles)
        while left < right :
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            hours = 0
            for p in piles:
                hours += math.ceil(p/mid)

            if hours <= h:
                right = mid
            else:
                left = mid+1

        return left
```
we use l<r :: bcoz we are doing r = mid ,but here we also include mid value for the next iteration--as it maybe also the minimum value.
if we want to use l<=r :: then we must update r = mid - 1,  else we will enter a infinite loop and we are discarding mid value

-> For minimum binary search:
- If mid works → keep mid → shrink right
- If mid fails → discard mid → move left to mid+1
  so:
    if check(mid):
        right = mid      # keep mid
    else:
        left = mid + 1   # discard mid
## Maximum Binary Search Template
  while left < right:
    mid = (left + right + 1) // 2
    if check(mid):
        left = mid
    else:
        right = mid - 1
- we do mid = (l + r + 1)//2 -> tht +1 is for preventing infinite loop when searching for maximum.

// LC410. Split Array Largest Sum
in this prob :: mid represents -> The maximum allowed sum of any subarray.

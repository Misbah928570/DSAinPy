Sliding Wind Counting Prob:

Longest/Minimum problems:
→ We only care about one window size.

Counting problems:
→ We must count all possible windows.

There are 3 types of sliding window problems now in your toolkit:

1️⃣ Longest / Minimum type
- Expand
- Shrink based on validity
- Track best length

2️⃣ At Most K type (Counting)
- Expand
- Shrink while invalid
- do count += (right - left + 1)

3️⃣ Exactly K type
Use trick:
  exactly K = atMost(K) - atMost(K-1)

LC3325:  How many substrings contain at most 2 distinct characters?

class Solution:
    def numberOfSubstrings(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        ans = 0
        l = 0
        d = {}
        for c in s:
            d[c] = d.get(c, 0) + 1
            while d[c] == k:
                d[s[l]] -= 1
                l += 1
            ans += l
        return ans

LC992 : 
App - exactlyK = atMost(K) - atMost(K-1)
